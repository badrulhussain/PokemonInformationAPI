I have added Swagger for documentation it with will pop up once you run the application or use localhost/swagger on the url. I didn't have time to go through "httpie" but I was going to use DiscoveryService running two projects but I ran out of time and I also did not have much time to add unit-test. There is two project and you will have to run then individually.
I hope you guys like it.
