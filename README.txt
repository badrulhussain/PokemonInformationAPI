I have added Swagger for documentation it will pop up once you run the application or use localhost/swagger on the url. I didn't have time to go through "httpie" but I was going to use DiscoveryService running two projects but I ran out of time and I also did not have much time to add unit-test. There are two projects and you will have to run them individually.
I hope you guys like it.
